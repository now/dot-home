# 1  Terminal Settings
# ====================


# TODO: The only reason to set this is that it’s not a sane default and that it
# clutters the window list by suffixing the window number with a ‘$’ to show
# that the window is “logged in”.
deflogin off
# TODO: 100 is way too low a default under any normal circumstances.
defscrollback 8192
# NOTE: Leaving maptimeout at the default of 300, Esc key will be delayed.
maptimeout 10
# TODO: Screen should really set this, provided that the base terminal is
# capable and screen has been compiled with 256 color support.
term "screen-256color"
# TODO: Set msgminwait 0 so that we can do ^Tw followed by ^T<N> without a 1
# second delay as is the default now.  We won’t have to set this if we don’t
# set hardstatus below.  The reason behind the delay is that screen has to
# update the hardstatus when we switch windows and that’s considered to be a
# message, thus the timeout triggers.



# 2  Formats
# ==========


# TODO: Do we really need to redefine this?
activity "%0c activity: %n %t"
# TODO: Do we really need the hardstatus line?  Only real use right now is that
# screen resizes correctly with it and not without it in a new gnome-terminal
# (inside XMonad).
hardstatus alwayslastline "%{= dd}%?%-w%?%{..g}%n %t%?[%u]%?%{-}%+w%-014= %M %d, %0c"



# 3  Bindings
# ===========


escape ^Tt

# TODO: How often do I need to do this, anyway?
bind \# colon "number "
