# TODO: This remains until pam_ssh can add keys that aren’t available until
# pam_mount has started its session.  The problem is that pam_ssh tries to
# decrypt the keys in the authentication phase.  This makes sense if you want
# to authenticate the whole session by authenticating against one of the keys,
# but not if you only want to provide single sign-on behavior for the session.
# 
# I’m not sure how to best solve this, so I’ll have to contact the pam_ssh
# developers and ask if this is something they can look into.
